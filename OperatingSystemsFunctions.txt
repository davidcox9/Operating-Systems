Providing a user interface

A User Interface is the way in which you interact with an operating system. The User Interface (UI) controls how a user enters data and instructions, as well as how information is displayed on screen. Two types of UIs are Graphical, and Command-Line. With a GUI, the way you interact with menus and visual images is by touching, pointing, tapping, or clicking buttons and objects to issue commands. Command-Line uses typed commands represented by short keywords or abbreviations, or by pressing special keys on the keyboard to enter data and instructions
